## About <a name = "about"></a>

This is my humble personal site. Mostly dedicated to have an online place to display my photos.

## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You just need to install [volta](https://volta.sh/).

Also I recommend to set aliases for npm on mac, since is a pain to type the full command. I use Fish, so it look like:
```fish
alias pn 'npx pnpm'
alias np 'npx pnpm'
```

### Installing

```
node -v # just to trigger volta to download the specified node version
npx pnpm install
```

## Usage <a name = "usage"></a>

```
npx pnpm start
```
